# Usage

## Development env with docker-compose.yml

You can you this docker-compose.yml file to develop:

```
www:
  image: touch4it/docker-php7:latest
  volumes:
    - ".:/var/www/html"
  ports:
    - "80"
```

Of course, you are free to add linked containers like database, caching etc.

Use ```docker-compose up``` command to start your development environment.

## Build production image

You can build production ready image with Dockerfile like this:

```
FROM touch4it/docker-php7:latest
ADD . /var/www/html
```

## Environment variables

This image uses several environment variables which are easy to miss. While none of the variables are required, they may significantly aid you in using the image.

### `ADMIN_EMAIL`

The ServerAdmin sets the contact address that the server includes in any error messages it returns to the client.
If the httpd doesn't recognize the supplied argument as an URL, it assumes, that it's an email-address and prepends it with `mailto:` in hyperlink targets.
However, it's recommended to actually use an email address, since there are a lot of CGI scripts that make that assumption.
If you want to use an URL, it should point to another server under your control. Otherwise users may not be able to contact you in case of errors.

Default value: `webmaster@localhost`

For Apache-based images

### `PHP_TIME_ZONE`

Defines the default timezone used by the date functions

http://php.net/date.timezone

Default value: `Europe/London`

### `PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT`

Maximum amount of memory a script may consume

http://php.net/memory-limit

Default value: `256M`

### `PHP_UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE`

Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.

http://php.net/upload-max-filesize

Default value: `32M`

### `PHP_POST_MAX_SIZE`

Maximum size of POST data that PHP will accept.
Its value may be 0 to disable the limit.
It is ignored if POST data reading is disabled through enable_post_data_reading.

http://php.net/post-max-size

Default value: `32M`
